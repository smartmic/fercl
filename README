*WORK IN PROGRESS* 
*ENCRYPTION NOT YET IMPLEMENTED*
fercl â€” fast encryption for the command line.
fercl is a program that converts data to and from encrypted base64 strings.
Acting like a Unix filter, it uses stdin and stdout for input and output
channels. It is a simple tool for symmetric encryption of data and specifically
designed to be used within shell pipelines.
fercl builts upon proven code and libraries:
    * Gnulib for base64 conversion
    * libsodium for the encryption
